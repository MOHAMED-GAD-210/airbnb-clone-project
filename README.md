# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
A simplified clone of AirBnB aimed at practicing full-stack web development concepts: user authentication, listing creation, booking flow, and a responsive UI.

## Project Goals
- Build a web application that allows users to create accounts, list properties, and make bookings.
- Implement role-based features (host vs guest).
- Practice RESTful APIs, database modeling, and basic front-end UI/UX.
- Deploy a working demo (optional).

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React or Vue)
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite (for development)
- Authentication: JWT or session-based auth
- Optional: Docker, Nginx, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
