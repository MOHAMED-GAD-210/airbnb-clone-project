# AirBnB Clone Project

## Overview
A simplified clone of AirBnB aimed at practicing full-stack web development concepts: user authentication, listing creation, booking flow, and a responsive UI.

## Project Goals
- Build a web application that allows users to create accounts, list properties, and make bookings.
- Implement role-based features (host vs guest).
- Practice RESTful APIs, database modeling, and basic front-end UI/UX.
- Deploy a working demo (optional).

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optionally React or Vue)
- Backend: Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express)
- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite (for development)
- Authentication: JWT or session-based auth
- Optional: Docker, Nginx, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

## Technology Stack

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework used for building the backend logic, RESTful APIs, and handling authentication, routing, and server-side operations.

### 2. PostgreSQL
A powerful open-source relational database used to store user data, property listings, and booking information with high reliability and scalability.

### 3. HTML5
Used to create the structure of the web pages and define the layout of the AirBnB Clone interface.

### 4. CSS3
Responsible for styling the application, ensuring it looks modern, clean, and responsive on all devices.

### 5. JavaScript
Adds interactivity to the frontend — used for dynamic content updates and communication with backend APIs (AJAX or Fetch requests).

### 6. RESTful API
Defines how the frontend and backend communicate by sending and receiving JSON data through HTTP requests.

### 7. Git & GitHub
Used for version control, collaboration, and maintaining the source code history across the project team.

### 8. Docker *(optional if used)*
Used to containerize the application for easier deployment and consistent environments across different systems.

## Database Design

The database for the AirBnB Clone project will include several key entities that represent the main components of the application.

### 1. Users

- **id** (Primary Key)
- **name**
- **email**
- **password_hash**
- **role** (guest or host)
- **date_joined**

### 2. Properties
Represents the listings created by hosts.
- **id** (Primary Key)
- **title**
- **description**
- **price_per_night**
- **location**
- **host_id** (Foreign Key → Users)

### 3. Bookings
Tracks reservations made by guests.
- **id** (Primary Key)
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users)
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties)
- **check_in_date**
- **check_out_date**
- **total_price**

### 4. Reviews
Allows users to leave feedback on properties they’ve stayed in.
- **id** (Primary Key)
- **user_id** (Foreign Key → Users)
- **property_id** (Foreign Key → Properties)
- **rating** (1–5)
- **comment**
- **created_at**

### 5. Payments
Stores payment details for completed bookings.
- **id** (Primary Key)
- **booking_id** (Foreign Key → Bookings)
- **amount**
- **payment_method**
- **status**
- **payment_date**

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
This feature allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.  
It includes authentication and authorization so that each user has secure access to their data and actions (e.g., guests vs hosts).

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings.  
Each listing includes information like title, description, location, price per night, and photos, helping guests find suitable accommodations.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can browse available properties and make reservations for specific dates.  
The system automatically checks availability, calculates total price, and creates a booking record linked to both the guest and the property.

### 4. Review & Rating System
After completing a stay, guests can leave reviews and rate properties.  
This helps maintain trust and transparency in the platform by providing feedback to both hosts and future guests.

### 5. Payment Integration
Enables users to make secure payments for bookings.  
Each transaction is linked to a booking and includes details like payment amount, method, and status to ensure financial accuracy.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Users can search for properties by city, price range, date, or amenities.  
This makes finding the right accommodation fast and efficient, enhancing the user experience.

### 7. Admin Dashboard (optional)
An admin user can monitor all platform activities, manage users, handle disputes, and remove inappropriate listings.  
This feature ensures platform quality and compliance with guidelines.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to protect user data, maintain platform integrity, and prevent unauthorized access.  
The following security measures will be implemented in the AirBnB Clone project:

### 1. Authentication
Ensures that only registered and verified users can access the system.  
This prevents unauthorized users from performing actions like viewing or booking properties, and protects user accounts from misuse.

### 2. Authorization
Defines what each user is allowed to do once authenticated.  
For example, a host can create and manage properties, while a guest can only make bookings.  
This helps enforce role-based access and prevents data manipulation.

### 3. Data Encryption
All sensitive information (like passwords and payment details) will be encrypted both in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest (in the database).  
This protects user credentials and financial data from being exposed in case of interception or database breaches.

### 4. Rate Limiting
Restricts the number of API requests a single user or IP can make in a given time.  
This helps protect the system from brute-force attacks, spam, and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.

### 5. Input Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated to prevent malicious input such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).  
This ensures that only properly formatted, safe data is processed by the server.

### 6. Secure Authentication Tokens (JWT)
JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for secure session management.  
They allow stateless authentication and ensure that each request can be verified without exposing sensitive credentials.

### 7. Secure Payment Handling
Payment APIs will use trusted gateways with strong encryption and verification mechanisms.  
This ensures that all financial transactions are processed safely and protects users from fraud.

---

### Why API Security Is Crucial
- **Protecting User Data:** Prevents unauthorized access to personal information.  
- **Maintaining Trust:** Users can confidently use the platform knowing their data is secure.  
- **Ensuring System Stability:** Prevents attacks that could disrupt services.  
- **Compliance:** Meets privacy and data protection standards required for modern web platforms.

## CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment/Delivery**.  
It is a set of practices and automated processes that allow developers to integrate code changes frequently, test them automatically, and deploy them quickly and reliably to production.

### Importance for the Project
Implementing a CI/CD pipeline ensures that new code added to the AirBnB Clone project is automatically tested and validated before being deployed.  
This reduces human error, speeds up the release cycle, and maintains a consistent and stable version of the application across all environments.  
It also allows multiple developers to collaborate efficiently without breaking existing features.

### Tools Used
Several tools can be used to implement the CI/CD process:
- **GitHub Actions:** Automates testing, building, and deployment workflows directly within GitHub.  
- **Docker:** Provides containerization to ensure consistent environments during testing and deployment.  
- **Jenkins:** An open-source automation server used for building and deploying applications.  
- **AWS CodePipeline / Azure DevOps / GitLab CI:** Alternative CI/CD platforms that manage automated builds, tests, and deployments.

### Example Workflow
1. Developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.  
2. GitHub Actions triggers automated tests and code linting.  
3. If tests pass, the code is built and packaged into a Docker container.  
4. The container is deployed automatically to the testing or production environment.  

By using CI/CD pipelines, the AirBnB Clone project achieves faster development cycles, improved collaboration, and more reliable software delivery.
